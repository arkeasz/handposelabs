HandPoseLabs is an experimental repository for testing and exploring different ways to use hand landmarks with MediaPipe Hands. The goal is to experiment with hand tracking, gesture recognition, and landmark-based interactions in various applications.

This repository serves as a sandbox for trying out new ideas, optimizing detection methods, and refining hand pose algorithms. ðŸš€
